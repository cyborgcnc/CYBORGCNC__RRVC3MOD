# LCD MOUNT

This is the case and mount I used for my LCD, to mount in front of the printer.

The case is made to fit the BTT Pi TFT50 LCD display.

As this is a display that is meant to connect directly to the pi, over the DSI coonector, I used a breakout DSI circuit board, which allowed
me to run cables through the printer frame (I used Cat 6), and then another breakout board to connect to the pi in the back of my printer.
You can see some of the photos I have posted.

As such, this you might need to remix, depending on the screen, on on the way you will connect your screen.  I designed this specifically for my purpose,
but I have included the .step files, which you can easily bring into any CAD package, and remix as needed.  I might redesing this at some point in time,
as I would make the mounting a little easier, but the mount works for me, so it is not per say broken that needs fixing... :-)

I have also included the mounting clips/brackets, I have used to mount to the front 3030 extrusions.  Print one and another in mirror mode, for the 
left and right.  Again, modify as needed.
