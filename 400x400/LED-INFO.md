# LED INFORMATION and Details

The LEDs I used to light the side panels, are know as mini-skinny-neopixel LEDs.  They are available from adafruit, and here is the link where you can find them:

These are very easy to implement for lighting panels from the side, especially engraved panels.  Engraved panels when lit from the side, produce a neon like
effect, which is really cool.  You can tie this with printer events.  The posibilites are endless.
