# LED INFORMATION and Details

The LEDs I used to light the side panels, are know as mini-skinny-neopixel LEDs.  They are available from adafruit, and here is the link where you can find them:

These are very easy to implement for lighting panels from the side, especially engraved panels.  Engraved panels when lit from the side, produce a neon like effect, which is really cool.  You can tie this with printer events.  The possibilities are endless.  There are many way to achieve this, and it all depends on the firmware you will choose for your printer.  Klipper has support, as well as others.  Another way to do this (and the way I am doing it) is to use an external controller to control the RGB LEDs and then through a plugin, tie them to printer events.  Octoprint supports the WLED project, which is one of the coolest way to control the LEDs, with an ESP8266 board (which again, is what I am using).  More reading for you here:

Yes, I am using Octoprint, and until Fluidd or mainsail come close to the functionality, it is what I will be using.  I have had no issues with my printer, or stuttering, or any of the other nonsense you read online.  It works, and it works great!

The clips I am using, I am simply attaching to the side-panels with double-sided tape, such as 3M, or really any other brand you like.  I have provided the STEP files, so you can shorten, or lengthen this model to your liking, and to your panel, in your favorite CAD package.  For me to provide every flavor, for every printer is not going to happen.

ENJOY!
