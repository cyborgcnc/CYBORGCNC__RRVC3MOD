# PANELS
Here you will find the side, front door, and bottom panels I created for the printer.  THe back panel, is Aluminum Composite material.  This is commonly referred to as ACM panel material, and it is thin aluminum, on both sides, with some sort of plastic in the middle.  The reason why I chose this for the back, is because aluminum can act as a good heatsink, but also, it is VERY easy to work with, especially for mounting.  Simple machine screws are all that are needed to be able to mount electronics, power supply, etc etc,  Obviously, since aluminum is conductive, you must take care as to how you mount these, and the pictures of my machine, can show you how I mounted mine.  You will also notice, that there are holes cut for the Carbon/HEPA filter I designed.  You can remix this if you want, and leave the holes out, but that is why they are there.  Anyway, pretty straight forward, and if you have any questions, just ask.
