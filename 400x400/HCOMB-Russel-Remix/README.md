# Russel Brown Mod

Russel has produced (Thank you!) a version of my HoneyComb sides to accomodate the RatRig rj45 Adaptor.

Modified honeycomb back panels for the Standard Ratrig RJ45 connector
and push-fit IEC fused inlets all based on Spiro Argyros's most
excellent work found here:

https://github.com/cyborgcnc/CYBORGCNC__RRVC3MOD

The STL files are half panels and should match up with the top half STL
files in Spiro's github.  The STEP files are full length for those with
large enough print beds.


The printed RJ45 'keystone' socket holder is here:

https://github.com/Rat-Rig/V-core-3/blob/main/cad/printed_parts/extra/stl/lan_socket_adapter.stl

and bolts to this back panel with M3x16 screws.

I couldn't find the IEC connector used by Spiro so I used a push fit one
which seem more freely available. I got mine from here:

https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/193566579018?var=493785159538

The push fit IEC connector requires a notional 47x27mm cutout and
notches for the retaining clips.  In reality, I found it was slightly
oversize so the cutout allows for this.

While these parts are notionally labeled as 'Left' one can, of course,
simply mirror them in your slicer if you want to use them on the right
hand side.
