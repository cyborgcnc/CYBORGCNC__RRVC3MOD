# HoneyComb Sides for Electronics

As you can see, these are the sides I designed for placing on the sides of the electronics area.  These are for the 400mm Printer! (I might remix these later for other sizes,
but for now, 400mm it is).

Pretty self explanatory as to how you mount them.  I have SPLIT UP the files, so that you can print them on a reasonably sized printer.  All you need is some 3mm screws, and
3mm 30x30 T-nuts to mount them.

The Left side, is made to accept an AC/Fuse combination plug, like the one you can find on Amazon.  I printed in ABS, flat side down, NO SUPPORTS needed...3 top/btm layers and 4 walls...
