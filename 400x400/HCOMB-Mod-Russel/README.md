# Russel Brown Mod

Russel has produced (Thank you!) a version of my HoneyComb sides to accomodate the RatRig rj45 Adaptor.

Also, the IEC inlet i am using doesn't seem easily available in the UK (Amazon and EBay searched) and the similar shaped ones are too large for the cutout 
I designed. As you can see below, Russel modified it for a snap-in version.  Modifications will be made as required once it is all tested out!
