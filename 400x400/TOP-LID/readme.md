# TOP LID FILES

Here is where you can find all the files that can be printed to construct the top lid.  The parts will require 3mm screws as well as heat inserts (M3-.05 SHORT).
This will make trhe assembly of the top lid very easy, with no glue required, as all parts are MECHANICALLY attached.  In addition, I have made the top lid able to
be sealed with common weather strip, and the size of this should be 5mm wide and 1mm thick (you can find it on amazon).

In addition to all this, the top part of the lid, has been designed to be able to also accept NeoPixel LEDs, and these can easily be attached around the inside of the
top rim, and wired as required.

All of my parts where printed out of ABS, and the panels for the lid sides, are polycarbonate (3mm thick) ( so it will handle heat well).  You can change this to any material you want.
