# 300mm Top Lid Remix by Phil Brickwood

This is a top lid remix very generously done by Phil Brickwood, for the 300x300mm model.  Phil will post more pictures when he receives his printer, and I am sure
any adjustments if needed.

You can reach him on the FB group of you have any questions.  Thanks for the contribution Phil!
