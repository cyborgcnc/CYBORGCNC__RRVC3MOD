# CYBORGCNC__RRVC3MOD
This is a modification I recently made to the RatRig VBcore3 3D printer.  I drew a lot of inspiration from members of the Voron team, as well as other folks who have and are modifying this awesome printer.  I have also been a long time computer/gaming rig Modder, and I used some of the techniques there to make this printer simply awesome looking (my opinion). All parts were 3D printed, and the panels for all the sides etc., were cut from polycarbonate on my “homemade” CNC machine.  All of the modeling was done in Solidworks, and this would not have been possible, if it was not for the great models provided by the RatRig team!

I will be placing all the models I used to mod this printer here over time.  You can find me on the Facebook Group, so post there if you have any questions.
