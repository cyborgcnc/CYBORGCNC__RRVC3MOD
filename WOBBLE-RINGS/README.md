# WOBBLE RINGS FOR VCORE3 PRINTERS

As you can see from the work here, I have created a set of “wobble rings” for the arms of the Vcore3.  This idea was originally posted by MirageC for his Hevort build.  
On his youtube video, he explains how he is able to source some very cheap ball screws, and make them better through the use of a system that allows them to 
freely move (if not dead straight).  As such, it eliminates print artifacts.  I thought this would be a good idea to use for the Vcore, and the leadscrews it uses. 
Ultimately, I would be looking for a belt driven Z, but at the moment, and due to the weight of the table, I put on the back burner.

Reason why I did this, was because I was getting small artifacts on my prints, and they were all measuring exactly 4mm apart, which pointed to screw wobble.
This is NOT to say you will have this problem!  In fact, the Vcore3 design is one that should ELIMINATE any sort of wobble, but if it shows up, it shows up.
Here is my fix here.

What you will need:

-You will have to print the Back-Arm, and then the Front Arms.  Bear in mind, that the Front arms are simply mirrors of each other.  
 So place the right one say in your slicer, mirror it, and you will have the left one.
 
-You will need to print the Rings.  These are comprised of Top Rings (you need three), Middle Rings (you need three) and Bottom Rings (you need three).

-Neodymium Magnets: 8mmx5mm

-Steel pins: 8mmx3mm (for the disks)

-Steel Pins: 3mmx35 (you can use the original ones that came with the kit).  These are for the arms, and where the ball end of the table rests.

-Magnets for the Arms: Use the ones that came with the printer, in the original arms.

-TR8x4 Nut (can be anti-backlash if you want)

-Heat Inserts (To attach to the Arms, which is used for attaching the TOP Rings to the Arms). I used 4x5.5 M3..so the SHORT M3 Heat Inserts.
