# MARCEL TOP LID FILES FOR VCORE3 500mm

Thanks to the GREAT WORK of Marcel Becker, we now have the panel sides, and the Top Lid for the 500mm Vcore3.  As you can see, Marcel did an absolute AWESOME job in remixing my 400mm design for the 500, and I have to say his color scheme is drop dead gorgeous!  As you can also see, he remixed the front doors, adding some really good looking handles to them!  Honored to be hosting these files here for sure!

Marcel is on our FB group, and if you guys have any questions, I am sure he will be more than glad to answer them.  He is currently working on building this printer, at which point, he will also post some more pictures of this awesome build!

THANK YOU Marcel for the awesome work!!
