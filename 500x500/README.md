# Honeycomb Sides for 500mm model

These are the Honeycomb side panles for the 500mm model, for the back electronics chamber (as shown in my 40mm build).
I have provided the .STEP files for these, so you can remix as needed, or basically "cut" as needed to print on a given printer.
Obviously, since these are around 632mm long, one would have to cut them at certain points, to print parts, and then put them
together during assembly.  This is very easily done, and the results are still great!

let me know if you have any questions, but pretty straight forward.  Mounting can be achieved with 3mm screws and 30x30 t-nuts.  When mounted, you will
not be able to see the screws, which makes for a very neat and nince appearance!
