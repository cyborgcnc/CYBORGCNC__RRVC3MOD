# CARBON HEPA FILTER

I wanted to design a filter for my 400mm build, that will allow me to print materials like ABS/ASA/PC etc. and be able to filter Particulate matter.
I did not want to design one that would vent the air to outside, as I wanted to keep all the hot air in the chamber, and this lead me to designing one
that is re-circulating the air.  For the most part, I think I achieved this, and so far, I have good results with this filter.

The filter uses a 120mm blower.  There was no sense in designing this with a regular radial fan, as pretty much any of those fans DO NOT have the
static pressure required to move air through a HEPA Filter, a pre-filter, and then Activated Carbon.  One can probably find such a fan, but it would more
than likely sound like a jet engine, at 24V volts.  The blower I am using is relatively quiet, and at 24V, it really pushes the air through with no issues.
