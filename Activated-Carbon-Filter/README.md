<h1 align="center">CARBON HEPA FILTER </h1>

I wanted to design a filter for my 400mm build, that will allow me to print materials like ABS/ASA/PC etc. and be able to filter Particulate matter.
I did not want to design one that would vent the air to outside, as I wanted to keep all the hot air in the chamber, and this lead me to designing one
that is re-circulating the air.  For the most part, I think I achieved this, and so far, I have good results with this filter.

The filter uses a 120mm blower.  There was no sense in designing this with a regular radial fan, as pretty much any of those fans DO NOT have the
static pressure required to move air through a HEPA Filter, a pre-filter, and then Activated Carbon.  One can probably find such a fan, but it would more
than likely sound like a jet engine, at 24V volts.  The blower I am using is relatively quiet, and at 24V, it really pushes the air through with no issues.

The filter uses an "Activated Carbon Catridge" that gets installed inside the printer chamber, and with a bracket, this is fastened to the back electronics panel.
In turn, there is also a HEPA filter bracket and assembly, that houses the filter duct, and the 24V blower.  This gets mounted on the backside of the Electronics
panel.  You can see how all thesse components are installed in the pictures, and the whole thing is actually pretty straight forward and self-explanatory.

The Activated Carbon can easily be purchased from a number of places.  The way the Catridge is assembled is, one has to use some fine mesh material.  I used
mesh that is normaly used for window screens, but really anything can be used, that allows the free movement of air.  This mesh material is glued and held in place by the retainer rings of the catridge.  As you can also see, the catridge has a square access hole at one of the sides, which is used to fill the catridge with Activated carbon.  You can then simply place a piece of tape over this to hold the carbon in place, and can easily be removed to replace the carbon.  Depending on the amount of printing you do, you will need to replace this every couple of months or so, but I have not done any extensive studies on the time frame (I welcome testing and suggestions).

The HEPA filter I used is one that is normally used for air purifiers, and this was cut to size, to fit inside the HEPA filter retainer, which then mounts to the 120mm Blower Housing.  Here are the links where I purchased most of these items described:
