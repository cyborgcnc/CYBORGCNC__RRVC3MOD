<h1 align="center">CAN Bus Modifications and Info</h1>

In this section I will detail the modifications I did to use a CAN bus tool Head for the Vcore3, and will also post the way I modified the EVA catridge to mount everything.  The product that I used, is the Mellow/FLY SHT42 board.  THey have two versions, I chose the SHT42, but both are pretty much identical in functionality.  I have included therr STEP files, so feel free to modify as needed, if you need to make changes to the way I mounted mine.

As you can see, since I am running an enclosed chamber, I tried to design a mount that will also incorporate a fan, so that I can cool the 2209 driver that is on the
tool head.  Mellow provides also ALL the connectors, as well as a heatsink, that gets mounted on top of the 2209.  I have to say, their quality is really good, and they 
did a good job on this board (time will tell for sure)

The pictures below, along with a couple of renderings, should be very self explanatory, as to how it all fits together.  I am using dual blowers for mine, and hence this is the way I modified the back plate of EVA.  You will need to remix or make other modifications if you are using a different setup.  At this point, I am NOT planning on modifying any other EVA mounts.
