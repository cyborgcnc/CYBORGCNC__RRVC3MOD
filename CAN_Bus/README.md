<h1 align="center">CAN Bus Modifications and Info</h1>

In this section I will detail the modifications I did to use a CAN bus tool Head for the Vcore3, and will also post the way I modified the EVA catridge to mount everything.  The product that I used, is the Mellow/FLY SHT42 board.  THey have two versions, I chose the SHT42, but both are pretty much identical in functionality.  I have included therr STEP files, so feel free to modify as needed, if you need to make changes to the way I mounted mine.
